# Predicting-the-Prescription-Class-of-an-unknow-Patient-using-a-Decision-Tree-Classifier

## About the Project
This project involves predicting the prescription class of an unknown patient using a Decision Tree Classifier.
The project using historical prescription data of patients and their response to different medication. Based on this, I will build a decision tree classifier to find a proper prescription of an unknown patient.

## Prerequisites
The following libraries and dependencies have been used in this project:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikitlearn
* Metrics
* Preprocessing
* train_test_split
* DecisionTreeClassifier


## The Dataset
The dataset used in this project has been obtained from the IBM Object Storage [here](/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/data/drug200.csv).
The dataset has the following features:
* Age	
* Sex
* Blood Pressure
* Cholestrol

The dataset has the following target:
* Drug

some features in this dataset are categorical, such as Sex or BP and have been encoded to numerical values since klearn Decision Trees does not handle categorical variables.
